# Changes in Biodiversity Intactness Index influenced by Urban Expansion in The Phoenix Metropolitan Area Over Time

## About

In a world dominated by humans and an ever-growing population. The ongoing loss of undeveloped land appears increasingly inevitable as human populations expand. Data released by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2021 identified Maricopa County as the U.S. county with the most significant increase in land development since 2001 [1]. This rapid landscape buildup has expanded into undeveloped area which has significant effects on biodiversity and the well-being of surrounding natural environments. 

This repository containts a Python notebook exploring value changes of the Biodviersit Intactness Index (BII) dataset[2,3] and analysis the impacts of urban expnasion in the Phoenix metropolian area between 2017 and 2020.

# Data Citation

A data/ directory was created inside the biodiversity-intactness-index-phoenix repository. Due to the large size of data, the data folder is included in ``.gitignore` and is not tracked by version control.

- BII data:io-biodiversity collection, from the Microsoft Planetary Computer's STAC catalog. This dataset was generated by Impact Observatory, in collaboration with Vizzuality. It contains terrestrial biodiversity intactness data at 100m resolution.
